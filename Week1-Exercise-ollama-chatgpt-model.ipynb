       "\n",
       "3. **Combine the Images**:\n",
       "   - Use software like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online photo editor to overlay the dragon image onto the Hawaiian background. Make sure to adjust the size and perspective so the dragon appears to be flying or hovering in the sky.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Blend and Adjust**:\n",
       "   - Use blending tools to ensure the dragon looks like a natural part of the scene. Adjust lighting and shadows to match the background, so the entire image looks cohesive.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Finalize and Save**: \n",
       "   - Once you’re satisfied with how your image looks, export it in your desired format (like JPEG or PNG).\n",
